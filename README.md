WUDS WaDE overlay
===

This project serves as content to overlay the WUDS WaDE wade source. The overlay is done during the artifact build process.  As content is added to the directories in this project, the empty `.keep` file may be removed from that directory. The `.keep` file is only used as a convention to allow adding empty directories to a git repository.

#### __wade.spec__
